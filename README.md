# specs-toolchain

Tooling for the [specs framework](https://github.com/Color-Of-Code/specs-framework): lint, scaffolding, change-request lifecycle, traceability links, canonical graph import, generation, validation, and cache rebuild for any host project that uses the framework.

It ships in two flavours that share the same engine:

1. **VS Code extension (recommended)** — bundles the `specs` binary and exposes the day-to-day commands from the palette, the Specs view, and tasks. Nothing extra to install.
2. **Engine only** — a single cross-platform Go binary for terminal users and CI.

You can use either one alone, or install both side by side.

## Quick start — VS Code extension

1. Download `specs-<your-platform>.vsix` from the latest [GitHub release](https://github.com/Color-Of-Code/specs-toolchain/releases).
2. Install it:

   ```bash
   code --install-extension specs-<your-platform>.vsix
   ```

3. Open a workspace and run **Specs: Init host** (new or existing project) or **Specs: Doctor** from the Command Palette.

The extension uses the workspace-local `bin/specs` when one is present and otherwise falls back to its bundled binary, so no separate engine install is required. See [extension/README.md](extension/README.md) for the settings reference.

## Quick start — engine only

```bash
go install github.com/Color-Of-Code/specs-toolchain/engine/cmd/specs@latest
specs --version
specs doctor
```

Release tarballs from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Color-Of-Code/specs-toolchain/releases) work too — drop the `specs` binary anywhere on `PATH`.

Full installation notes (extension settings, combining both, platform paths) live in [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).
