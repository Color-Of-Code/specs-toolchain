# Specs (VS Code extension)

VS Code support for the [specs-toolchain](https://github.com/Color-Of-Code/specs-toolchain)
framework. The extension bundles a matching `specs` binary; once
installed, the day-to-day Specs commands are reachable from the palette
without any separate engine installation. A few admin-only commands
(`init`, `format`, `vscode init`, `framework` registry management) remain
terminal-only — see [docs/commands.md](https://github.com/Color-Of-Code/specs-toolchain/blob/main/docs/commands.md).

This package is part of the [specs-toolchain](https://github.com/Color-Of-Code/specs-toolchain)
monorepo. Releases ship a per-platform `.vsix` attached to each
[GitHub release](https://github.com/Color-Of-Code/specs-toolchain/releases).

The traceability preview uses Cytoscape.js and the engine's canonical
`specs visualize traceability --format json` output, so the VS Code panel and
future standalone UI can share the same graph payload.
