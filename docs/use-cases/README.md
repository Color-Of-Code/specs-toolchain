# Use cases

User-facing workflows exposed by the specs engine. Each file describes one use case as: **Summary**, **Owner**, **Purpose**, **Entry point**, **Exit point**, and (where the flow has decision points) a **Workflow** with iteration loops.

The **Owner** column below names whichever party is normally responsible. Authoring use cases are owned by an **actor** in the authoring chain (see [../actors.md](../actors.md)); setup, review, and maintenance use cases are owned by an operational **role** (see [../roles.md](../roles.md)). For a one-page summary of what the engine delivers, see [../overview.md](../overview.md).
