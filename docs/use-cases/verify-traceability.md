# Verify requirement ↔ implementer links

## Summary

Check that every requirement listed as `Implemented By` a feature or
component is reciprocally listed in that feature/component's
`Requirements` section, and vice versa.

## Purpose

Guarantee bidirectional traceability across the model. One-way links
silently rot; this check turns them into a CI failure.

## Entry point

`specs link check`

Or VS Code palette: **Specs: Check links**.

## Exit point

Zero exit on full symmetry. Non-zero with a list of asymmetric links
(missing back-reference, dangling target, wrong id) otherwise.

## Iteration

Fix the reported file(s), re-run `specs link check`. Pair with
[`specs visualize traceability`](visualize-traceability.md) when
diagnosing structural gaps rather than individual missing links.
