# Author a change request

## Summary

Create a numbered change request (CR), draft product requirements,
requirements, use cases, and components inside it, then drain the finalised
files into their canonical homes under `product/` and `model/`.

## Owner

The authoring chain itself — see [../actors.md](../actors.md):

- **Stakeholder** *(actor)* opens the CR and drafts the **product requirements** that describe the demand.
- **Author** *(actor)* re-formulates those into model **requirements**; **Analyst** *(actor)* writes the use cases; **Architect** *(actor)* the components — all inside the same CR.

## Purpose

Keep work-in-progress isolated under `change-requests/NNN-slug/` while
it is being reviewed, and only promote it to the durable product/model
once merged. Avoid stepping on other authors editing the same area.

## Entry point

`specs cr new --id <NNN> --slug <slug> [--title <t>] [--force] [--dry-run]`

Or VS Code palette: **Specs: New change request**.

Pre-conditions: the host is initialised (`.specs.yaml` exists); the CR
id is not already taken (unless `--force`).

## Exit point

After **drain**: every CR-local artifact is `git mv`d into its canonical
location — product requirements into `product/`, model artifacts into the
matching subtree under `model/` — and the original CR folder is empty (or
removed), ready for the merge commit.

## Workflow

1. **Create** the CR shell with `specs cr new`. This instantiates the
   `change-request` template tree under `change-requests/NNN-slug/`.
2. **Author** content. Use [`specs scaffold`](scaffold-model-artifact.md)
   with `--cr <NNN>` to add product requirements, requirements, use cases,
   components *inside* the CR folder.
3. **Iterate** locally:
    - Run [`specs format`](lint-and-format.md) to keep markdown tidy.
    - Run [`specs lint`](lint-and-format.md) for style and
      cross-reference checks.
    - Run [`specs cr status`](../commands.md) to list CRs and per-area file counts.
4. **Review** with collaborators on the CR branch.
5. **Drain** with `specs cr drain --id <NNN>` (use `--dry-run` first,
   then `--yes` to apply). The engine `git mv`s product requirements into
   `product/` and model artifacts into the matching `model/` subtree.
6. **Verify** with [`specs graph validate`](verify-traceability.md) and
   [`specs lint --baselines`](maintain-baselines.md) before merging.

### Iteration

Steps 2–4 repeat until the CR is approved. After drain, if the merge
introduces conflicts, resolve them and re-run `lint` + `graph validate`.
