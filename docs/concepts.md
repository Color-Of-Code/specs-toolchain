# Concepts

## Paths

Three paths matter and are referenced throughout the documentation and in `specs doctor`:

- **specs root** — the directory that contains `.specs.yaml`, `model/`, `product/`, and `change-requests/`. This is what `specs` operates on.
- **host repo** — the git repository that contains the specs root. It can _be_ the specs root (when the repo is dedicated to specs) or contain it as a subdirectory or submodule.
- **framework dir** — where the generic framework content (`templates/`, `process/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, lint config — collectively `.specs-framework`) is materialised. In **managed** mode this is the user cache dir; in **local** mode it is whatever `framework_dir` points at.

`specs doctor` prints all three so you can verify what was detected.

## Product vs. model

Two trees hold persistent specification artifacts:

- `product/` — **product requirements** (PRs): what the stakeholder asked for. Plain prose, the stakeholder's vocabulary, one PR per coherent demand. Sourced from the initial product description and from every subsequent change request.
- `model/` — **model artifacts**: requirements (MRs), features, components, services, APIs. The MR is a re-formulation of one or more PRs in a precise, testable form that can be implemented and verified.

Each PR has a `## Realised By` section linking to the MRs that realise it; each MR has a `## Realises` section linking back. Together with the existing `Implemented By` / `Requirements` pair this gives a continuous traceability chain:

```text
product-requirement ──► requirement ──► feature / component / service / api
       (PR)               (MR)
```

This separation is what makes impact analysis tractable: edits to a PR surface as drift on every MR that realises it, and conversely a change in MR scope is traceable back to the PR that motivated it. `specs link check` enforces both directions; `specs visualize traceability` renders the full chain.

## Framework sources

A **framework source** is the origin from which `.specs-framework` content is obtained. Every `specs init` invocation resolves a framework source to populate the framework layer. Three kinds exist:

### Remote URL (default)

A git URL that the engine clones or caches. This is how most users consume the official `specs-framework` or a company fork:

```yaml
framework_url: https://github.com/Color-Of-Code/specs-framework.git
framework_ref: v1.0.0
```

### Local path

An existing directory on disk (your own checkout, a vendored snapshot, or a submodule):

```yaml
framework_dir: ../specs-framework
```

### Empty seed

For organisations that want to build a framework **from scratch** without forking an existing one. The engine pre-seeds an empty directory with the minimal directory skeleton expected by the toolchain (`templates/`, `process/`, `skills/`, `agents/`). This is an advanced, low-level option — it produces only the bare structure; all content must be authored by the caller.

```bash
specs framework seed --out /path/to/my-framework
```

> **Important:** the seeded directory is _not_ managed by the toolchain after creation. The caller is responsible for initialising a git repository in the output folder, pushing it to a remote, and maintaining it. The toolchain only creates the initial skeleton.

Once the seeded directory is pushed to a remote you can reference it like any other framework source:

```yaml
framework_url: https://git.example.com/my-org/my-framework.git
framework_ref: main
```

Or point at it locally during development:

```yaml
framework_dir: ../my-framework
```

## Framework registry

To avoid remembering URLs and to standardise framework selection across teams, the toolchain supports a **framework registry** — a name → source mapping stored in user-level configuration.

Registry entries live in `~/.config/specs/frameworks.yaml` (XDG-compliant path on Linux; platform equivalents elsewhere):

```yaml
# ~/.config/specs/frameworks.yaml
frameworks:
  default:
    url: https://github.com/Color-Of-Code/specs-framework.git
    ref: v1.0.0
  my-company:
    url: https://git.example.com/acme/specs-framework.git
    ref: main
  local-dev:
    path: ~/src/specs-framework
```

With a registry configured, `specs init` accepts `--framework <name>` instead of raw URLs:

```bash
specs init --framework my-company
specs init --framework local-dev
```

The `default` entry is used when no `--framework` flag is provided.

### Managing the registry

```bash
specs framework list                       # show registered entries
specs framework add <name> --url <URL> [--ref <ref>]
specs framework add <name> --path <dir>
specs framework remove <name>
specs framework seed --out <dir>           # create an empty skeleton
```

## Two ways to use the framework content

Regardless of the source, the framework content does **not** have to live inside the host repo. Pick one of two consumption modes:

### managed (default) — hidden, engine-fetched, shared across hosts

The engine fetches `.specs-framework` once into the user data dir and re-uses it across every host project on the machine. End users never see the content, never commit it, never update it manually.

- Location: `os.UserCacheDir()` + `/specs-toolchain/framework/<ref>/`. On Linux that resolves to `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/specs-toolchain/framework/<ref>/`; on macOS `~/Library/Caches/specs-toolchain/framework/<ref>/`; on Windows `%LocalAppData%\specs-toolchain\framework\<ref>`.
- Version pin: `framework_ref` in `.specs.yaml` (a tag or commit). The host commits **only** `.specs.yaml`; nothing else.
- Refreshing: `specs framework update --to <ref>` rewrites `framework_ref` and re-fetches if needed.
- This is what `specs init` gives you when `--framework` resolves to a URL-based registry entry.

### local — a directory you supply

Use this when you want the framework content under your own control: a regular checkout you can edit, a git submodule of the host repo, or a vendored snapshot without git history. Clone, vendor, or `git submodule add` the framework wherever you want, then point `framework_dir` at it:

```yaml
# .specs.yaml
framework_dir: ../specs-framework # or .specs-framework, or any absolute path
```

`specs init --framework <local-path>` writes this for you. The engine never touches the directory; refreshing it is your job (`git pull`, `git submodule update`, re-extracting a vendored tarball).

### Quick decision

| You are…                               | Use this                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| writing specs in a host project        | **managed**                               |
| editing templates / process docs       | **local** with an editable git checkout   |
| starting a brand-new framework         | **seed** then switch to **local**         |
| working air-gapped, no internet at all | **local** with a vendored snapshot        |

Switch modes any time by editing `.specs.yaml`; nothing else changes.
