# Development

## CLI

```bash
go test ./...
go build ./...
go install ./cmd/specs
```

## VS Code extension

```bash
pnpm --filter ./extension install
pnpm --filter ./extension run compile
```

See [extension/README.md](../extension/README.md) for the extension-specific settings, packaging notes, and platform matrix.

## Markdown lint & format

Repo-level docs are checked by the built-in Go style linter (`specs lint --style`) and formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Configs: [`cli/internal/lint/style_defaults.yaml`](../cli/internal/lint/style_defaults.yaml) (compiled-in defaults), [`.prettierrc.json`](../.prettierrc.json), [`.prettierignore`](../.prettierignore).

```bash
pnpm install         # once, at the repo root (for Prettier)
pnpm run md:check    # prettier --check + specs lint --style (what CI runs)
pnpm run md:format   # prettier --write
pnpm run md:lint     # specs lint --style only
```

The `markdown` job in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs the same checks on every push and pull request.

## Build (extension & CLI)

To build both the VS Code extension and the CLI binary in one step:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

- The CLI binary is built to `specs-toolchain/specs`.
- The extension is compiled in `specs-toolchain/extension`.

You can also build them individually:

```bash
pnpm run build:cli         # builds Go CLI
pnpm run build:extension   # builds VS Code extension
```

## Markdown lint & format (docs only)

All markdown lint and formatting checks only apply to `docs/*.md`.

```bash
pnpm run md:check   # prettier --check + specs lint --style (docs only)
pnpm run md:format  # prettier --write (docs only)
pnpm run md:lint    # specs lint --style (docs only)
```

The `markdown` job in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs the same checks on every push and pull request.

## Releases

Cross-platform release builds are produced by GoReleaser on git tags (`v*.*.*`). See [`cli/.goreleaser.yaml`](../cli/.goreleaser.yaml). Per-platform `.vsix` artifacts are attached to GitHub releases via `pnpm run package:extension -- <target>`, which stages the matching CLI binary into the extension before packaging.

## Status

Phase 1 — lint, layout auto-detection, `init` / `bootstrap` / `tools update`, **managed mode** (cache + auto-fetch).
**Phase 2** — `scaffold`, `cr {new,status,drain}`, `baseline {check,update}`, `link check`, `vscode init` shipped.
**Phase 3** — `visualize traceability` (DOT and Mermaid), `templates_schema` enforcement, `--layout submodule` shipped.
**VS Code extension** under `extension/` (in progress; see [extension/README.md](../extension/README.md)).

## pnpm

This repo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for all dev tooling, pins pnpm `10.33.2`, uses Node `24.15.0` for pnpm-managed commands, and enforces a 7-day minimum package release age during installs. If you have npm artifacts from a previous version, remove them:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules extension/node_modules package-lock.json extension/package-lock.json
pnpm install
```

Use `pnpm run ...` for repo scripts.

## Developing the VS Code Extension Locally

To incrementally test the VS Code extension without reinstalling it on every iteration, use `pnpm run deploy-dev`. That command sets up a symlink for live development, allowing changes to be picked up immediately after reloading the VS Code window.

### Steps

1. **Run the Deployment Command**

   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy-dev
   ```

   This command will:
   - Remove any previously installed `.vsix`-based extension (with confirmation).
   - Build the `specs` CLI binary into `extension/bin/`.
   - Compile the TypeScript extension source.
   - Symlink the `extension` folder into `~/.vscode/extensions/`.

2. **Reload the VS Code Window**

   After running the script, reload your VS Code window to apply the changes.

3. **Iterate on Changes**

   Any changes made to the extension source code will be reflected immediately after reloading the window.

This workflow ensures a smooth development experience without the need for repetitive installations.
